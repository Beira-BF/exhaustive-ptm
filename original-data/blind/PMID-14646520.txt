Caspase-2/NEDD-2 protease mediates execution of apoptosis in AK-5 tumor cells. 
AK-5 tumour cells have been shown to undergo apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The efficient killing of tumour cells by necrosis and apoptosis leads to spontaneous regression of the tumour. To investigate a possible involvement of caspase-2/Nedd-2 protease in AK-5 apoptosis, we introduced Nedd-2 gene in antisense orientation and showed inhibition of tumour cell apoptosis. Similarly introduction of the bcl-2 gene in tumour cells also inhibited the apoptotic programme. NK cells which have previously been shown to be the effector cells also fail to induce apoptosis in Nedd-2 antisense and bcl-2 transfected clones whereas NK mediated cytotoxic activity is not altered in the transfectants. These results suggest participation of Nedd-2 protease in the induction of apoptosis in AK-5 cells leading to tumour regression.
