The central role of the trans-Golgi network as a gateway of the early secretory pathway: physiologic vs nonphysiologic protein transit. 
The current review focuses upon recent advances concerning the interrelationship between the ER and the trans-Golgi network (ER-TGN), the ER and the nucleus (ER-nucleus), and the ER-ubiquitin-proteasomal pathways at the level of basic cell biology. The overall emphasis of this paper centers upon the high likelihood that measurements of ER-associated protein or gene expression levels are not representative of a strict ER alone phenotype. Rather, that ER phenotype reflects a synthesis of phenotypes derived from intracellular compartments and phosphorylated messengers in rapport with the ER. The ER-TGN, ER-nuclear, and ER-ubiquitin-proteasomal transit paths share the ability to feed into the decision of whether TGN vesicles can interact with specific phosphorylated residues in order to drive physiologic, constitutive, anterograde traffic, retrograde traffic, and degradation. TGN vesicles can: (a) traffic to endosomes versus plasma membrane phosphodomains depending upon the presence or the absence of select Golgi-localized gamma-ear containing ADP ribosylation factor-binding proteins and/or protein kinase D; (b) be maintained within the TGN in the presence of a phosphosorting acidic cluster motif adaptor; (c) transit back to the ER via specialized TGN/ER glycosyltransferases (which modulate phosphorylated proteins); (d) transit to the nucleus via phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-associated phosphodomains; and/or (e) retrotranslocate to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is equipped with E3 ligase potential, in order to further regulate endosomal versus plasma membrane traffic. The TGN is also a critical gateway for protein transit in the sense that, as a function of sorting within this compartment, proteins are sent to the axon, cell body, or dendrites. As the decision to sort to the axon versus the somatodendritic compartment is intimately tied to TGN function, future understanding of TGN biology at the levels of neurogenesis and protein sorting is predicted to also effectively increase our understanding of synaptic sorting/regulation.
