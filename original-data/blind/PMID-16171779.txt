Interaction of NUB1 with the proteasome subunit S5a. 
NUB1 interacts with a ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target the NEDD8 monomer and neddylated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Therefore, NUB1 is thought to be a potent downregulator of NEDD8 conjugation system. Since NUB1 possesses a UBL domain, which was previously shown to be an S5a-interacting motif in RAD23/HHR23, we initially hypothesized that NUB1 interacts with the S5a subunit of the proteasome through its UBL domain. To examine this, we performed an in vitro GST pull-down assay and a yeast two-hybrid assay. Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that NUB1 directly interacts with the S5a subunit through its C-terminal region between amino acid residues 536 and 584, not through its UBL domain. Although the UBL domain was not an S5a-interacting motif in NUB1, our further studies revealed that the UBL domain is required for the function of NUB1.
