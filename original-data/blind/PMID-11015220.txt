Role of metals in the reaction catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase. 
Protein farnesyltransferase catalyzes the posttranslational farnesylation of several proteins involved in signal transduction, including Ras, and is a target enzyme for antitumor therapies. Efficient product formation catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase requires an enzyme-bound zinc cation and high concentrations of magnesium ions. In this work, we have measured the pH dependence of the chemical step of product formation, determined under single-turnover conditions, and have demonstrated that the prenylation rate constant is enhanced by two deprotonations. Substitution of the active site zinc by cadmium demonstrated that one of the ionizations reflects deprotonation of the metal-coordinated thiol of the peptide "CaaX" motif, pK(a1) = 6.0. These data provide additional evidence for the direct involvement of a metal-coordinated sulfur nucleophile in catalysis. The second ionization was assigned to a hydroxyl on the pyrophosphate moiety of farnesyl pyrophosphate, pK(a2) = 7.4. Deprotonation of this group is important for binding of magnesium. This second ionization is not observed for catalysis in the absence of magnesium or when the substrate is farnesyl monophosphate. These data indicate that the maximal rate constant for prenylation requires formation of a zinc-coordinated thiolate nucleophile and enhancement of the electrophilic character at C1 of the farnesyl chain by magnesium ion coordination of the pyrophosphate leaving group.
