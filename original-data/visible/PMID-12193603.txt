The SUMO ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase family member Miz1/PIASxbeta /Siz2 is a transcriptional cofactor for TFII-I. 
We have shown previously that a TFII-I-related protein, hMusTRD1/BEN, represses transcriptional activity of TFII-I. The repression by hMusTRD1/BEN was hypothesized to occur via a two-step competition mechanism involving a cytoplasmic shuttling factor and a nuclear cofactor required for transcriptional activation of TFII-I. Employing a two-hybrid approach with both yeast genomic and mouse cDNA libraries in parallel, we have identified the RING-like zinc finger containing Miz1/PIASxbeta/Siz2, which is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase in the SUMO pathway, as the potential nuclear cofactor that interacts with both TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN. Our conclusion is based on the following observations. First, the interactions are biochemically confirmed in mammalian cells where Miz1/mPIASxbeta interacts with both TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN when these proteins are ectopically co-expressed. Second, co-expression of a nuclear localization signal-deficient mutant of Miz1/mPIASxbeta with wild type TFII-I fails to alter the subcellular localization of the former. Finally, ectopically expressed Miz1/mPIASxbeta augments the transcriptional activity of TFII-I and relieves the repression exerted by a mutant hMusTRD1/BEN that co-localized with TFII-I in the nucleus.
