But1 and But2 proteins bind to Uba3, a catalytic subunit of E1 for neddylation, in fission yeast. 
NEDD8/Rub1 is the most homologous protein to ubiquitin among the ubiquitin-like proteins, and it is covalently linked to target proteins via the C-terminal glycine residue in a manner analogous to ubiquitylation. However, the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of the NEDD8 ligation pathway remains elusive. Using the two-hybrid system, we isolated novel genes from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA library whose products bind to Uba3, which is a catalytic protein for E1-like activity of the NEDD8 pathway. We designated these genes but1(+) and but2(+) (for proteins that bind to Uba three). But1 is a nuclear protein and its overexpression caused cell elongation, which is a common phenotype of the NEDD8 pathway defective mutant in S. pombe. Furthermore, overexpression of but1(+) in ned8-temperature sensitive mutant had a deleterious effect even under permissive temperatures. Our results suggest that But1 may have an inhibitory role in the NEDD8 pathway.
