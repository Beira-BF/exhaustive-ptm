Synthesis and characterization of photoreactive insulin-like growth factor 1 derivatives for receptor analysis. 
Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF-1) was reacted with 4-azidosalicylic acid (Asa) to synthesize photoreactive IGF-1 derivatives. Depending on the time of reaction and the Asa/IGF-1 ratio, a mixture of mono-, bis-, and trisacylated derivatives and one tetraacylated derivative was produced, which was separated by reversed-phase HPLC. HPLC, PAGE, and MALDI mass spectrometry were used to determine the degree of the acylation and location of the photolabel insertion. After iodination of the three monoacylated photoreactive IGF-1 derivatives, the specific labeling of the receptor could be proved. Together with a comparative investigation in which B29-Asa-insulin was used, the results suggest corresponding contact areas for IGF-1 and insulin with the insulin receptor ectodomain.
