Protection against Fas/APO-1- and tumor necrosis factor-mediated cell death by a novel protein, sentrin. 
Fas/APO-1 and TNF receptor 1 share a common signaling motif in their cytoplasmic tail called the "death domain." Using the death domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, several death domain-containing proteins that participate in cell death signaling have been identified. Here we report the isolation of a novel protein, sentrin, which interacts with Fas/APO-1 and TNF receptor 1 but not with FADD/MORT1 or CD40. Two-hybrid interaction assays reveal that sentrin associates only with the signal-competent forms of Fas/APO-1 or TNF receptor 1 death domains. Sentrin is a novel protein of 101 amino acids with homology to ubiquitin, Nedd8, and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, Smt3. When overexpressed, sentrin provides protection against both anti-Fas/APO-1 and TNF-induced cell death.
