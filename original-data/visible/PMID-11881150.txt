[Monoclonal antibodies against protein Daxx and its localization in nuclear domains 10] 
Nuclear domains 10 (ND10) were first detected occasionally using antibodies to an antigen of unknown nature (Ascoli, Maul, 1991). Further on it was shown that ND10 were sites of locality of the number of proteins (PML, Sp 100, pRB) (Sterndorf et al., 1992; Kamitani et al., 1998), the majority of which are modified with ubiquitin-like small proteins-modifiers (SUMO) (Ishov, Maul, 1996). In addition, it was shown that ND10 were sites of primary localization, transcription and replication of some DNA-viruses (SV40, virus of simple herpes 1, adenovirus 5) (Ishov, Maul, 1996; Ishov et al., 1997). Except for SV40, these viruses produce proteins able to modify ND10, or leading to degradation of ND10-associated proteins (Maul et al., 1993; Maul, Everett, 1994). This degradation is accompanied with protein desumofication and, later, with hydrolysis on the ubiquitin-proteosomal way (Everett et al., 1998, 1999). Cell incubation with interferon leads to augmentation of the number and dimension of ND10 owing to increased expression of Sp100 and PML (Lavau et al., 1995; Grotzinger et al., 1996). In all, these data make it possible to put forward a hypothesis that ND10 may represent a peculiar cell storage ("dépôt") of proteins regulated according to the "accumulation-drop" principle (Ishov et al., 1997; Maul, 1998). However, this hypothesis requires further factual grounds.
