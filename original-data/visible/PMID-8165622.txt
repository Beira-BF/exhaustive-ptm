The use of active centre acylation to control the pharmacokinetic profile of a recombinant chimaeric plasminogen activator. 
Recombinant hybrid plasminogen activators consisting of the "A" chain of plasminogen linked to the "B" chain of t-PA that are inhibited rapidly by plasma protease inhibitors have recently been described (Robinson et al. Circulation 1992; 86: 548-552). We have now shown that following bolus administration of native hybrid to guinea pigs, fibrinolytic activity was cleared rapidly from the circulation. Active centre acylation appeared to protect the hybrid from inhibition and allowed material to circulate as potentially active species for prolonged periods. Clearance rates of a range of acyl derivatives of the hybrid were 7-35-fold slower than for native hybrid and 20-100-fold slower than for t-PA. Clearance rates were influenced markedly by deacylation rate, such that clearance half-life correlated well with deacylation half-life. We have thus shown that it is feasible to control the pharmacokinetic profile of a recombinant hybrid plasminogen activator over a wide range by selection of an appropriate acyl group for attachment to the active site. Such control is not possible with plasminogen activators that are cleared predominantly by mechanisms other than inhibition.
