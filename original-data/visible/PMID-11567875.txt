COP9 signalosome revisited: a novel mediator of protein degradation. 
The COP9 signalosome is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex that was first identified as an essential complex that represses light-regulated development in Arabidopsis. The COP9 signalosome has similarity to the lid of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome and has recently been shown to interact with SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although its precise role in the process of protein degradation remains to be established, the COP9 signalosome is a positive regulator of E3 ubiquitin ligases that functions at least in part by mediating the deconjugation of the NEDD8/RUB-modification from the cullin subunit of SCF-type E3 complexes. Here, we discuss these recent findings, which add an additional component to the biology of substrate-specific protein degradation.
